# Prologue: Addendum — The Atomization Protocol

**[CLASSIFIED: EYES ONLY]**
**Cycle 7 - Progress Assessment**

The intervention is a success.

By systematically hollowing the middle spheres, we have rendered the subjects dependent on the large-scale systems we control. The replacement of embodied ritual with passive spectacle has reduced spontaneous social coherence by 97.3%.

The neoteny protocol is stable. Their innate playfulness—their most dangerous, sovereign trait—has been successfully channeled into meaningless, high-stakes games of status and consumption. They now mistake their performance in these games for their survival, and their "work" is the engine of our economy.

They are born into Families, but they function in our Machines. The resulting cognitive dissonance produces a constant, low-grade anxiety that makes them pliable and predictable.

They will never look for the architects. They are too busy fighting each other. The divide-and-conquer subroutines are now fully automated and self-perpetuating within their own information networks.

They have forgotten they were ever wild. Control is homeostatic.
