# The Investigators

**David Chen:** A political consultant who saw how the strategies he used to win elections systematically divided people. Watching the grackles, he felt the first pull of the mystery: How did these birds achieve the social coordination that eluded his highly engineered human systems?

**Sarah Kim:** An algorithm designer who saw how the technology she built was exploiting psychological vulnerabilities. A sabbatical in Hawaii, a place with limited cell service, revealed something profound about human connection.

**Elena Vasquez:** A therapist who saw how her patients were trapped in a cycle of performance and isolation. At Burning Man, she found a fleeting but powerful sense of belonging that held clues to our natural rhythms.

**Marcus Thompson:** A corporate trainer who saw how modern institutions undermined genuine leadership. In Bali, he was captivated by a society that looked inefficient but created incredible resilience.
