- Include Fertility Desire vs Reality Gap as a core signal

Initial dimensions (to refine with data):

- Belonging, Reciprocity, Conflict Repair, Contribution Velocity
- Asset Productivity, Mentorship Density, Governance Participation

Note: This chapter introduces the concept; implementation details and experimental methods appear in the Scientific Learning Engine chapter.
