# Chapter 68: The Great Disintermediation

The collapse of the Alliance Sphere was a centuries-long project, but it was supercharged in the late 20th and early 21st centuries by a powerful new force: **the internet.**

The internet's promise was one of "disintermediation"—the elimination of the "middlemen" who stood between us and what we wanted. We were promised direct access to information, to commerce, to potential partners, and to each other.

But this process of disintermediation was a trap. The "middlemen" that were eliminated were not just inefficient gatekeepers; they were the very social structures that made up the Alliance Sphere. The internet didn't just remove friction; it removed the human relationships that provided mentorship, accountability, context, and resilience.

This process, which I call **The Great Disintermediation**, accelerated the hollowing of the middle, leaving the individual more isolated than ever. It attacked the four main pillars of the Alliance Sphere.

### 1. The Revolution in the Mating Market

*   **Before:** Romantic connections happened through social networks—friends, family, community events. These "middlemen" provided social context, filtering, and accountability.
*   **The Promise:** Direct access to unlimited potential partners via dating apps.
*   **The Reality:** A brutal marketplace that rewards a tiny percentage of users and leaves the rest feeling rejected and isolated. Without the social context of the Alliance Sphere, dating became a high-stakes performance judged on superficial metrics, destroying the social infrastructure required for family formation.

### 2. The Collapse of Business Hierarchies

*   **Before:** Businesses had layers of mentorship—apprentices, journeymen, supervisors. This "middle management" was the social infrastructure that transformed young workers into competent professionals.
*   **The Promise:** The "gig economy," where everyone is their own boss, with direct access to customers.
*   **The Reality:** A winner-take-all economy where platform owners capture most of the value, while millions of "independent contractors" compete in a race to the bottom with no job security, benefits, or career development. The elimination of the "middlemen" also eliminated the relationships that provided economic stability and professional growth.

### 3. The Destruction of Information Hierarchies

*   **Before:** Information systems had curators—editors, teachers, librarians, experts. These "middlemen" provided context, verification, and gradual learning pathways.
*   **The Promise:** Direct access to all information, eliminating gatekeepers.
*   **The Reality:** Information overload, misinformation epidemics, and the collapse of shared truth. Without the trusted intermediaries of the Alliance Sphere, people retreat into echo chambers, unable to distinguish reliable information from manipulation.

### 4. The Evaporation of Community Infrastructure

*   **Before:** Communities had layers of social organization—neighborhoods, clubs, churches, and associations. These "middlemen" connected individuals to larger purposes and provided multiple layers of belonging.
*   **The Promise:** Global connection through online communities and social networks.
*   **The Reality:** Superficial connections that provide the *illusion* of community without the substance. Online groups lack the mutual aid, accountability, and deep relationships that make the alliances of real communities resilient.

The cruel irony of the Great Disintermediation is that in our rush to eliminate inconvenient social intermediaries, we destroyed the very fabric of the Alliance Sphere, trading the messiness of human relationships for the clean, cold isolation of the digital platform.

Aha: Platforms don’t just remove “middlemen”; they remove the human mesh that made trust, context, and apprenticeship possible.

Try this (2 min): Pick one area (dating, work, learning, community). Write one “re-intermediation” step: a human connector you can add back (mentor, guild, matchmaker, librarian, host).

Guardrail: Don’t rebuild gatekeepers as bottlenecks. Re-intermediation is many small, transparent connectors, not one controlling node.
