## Important Guidelines

### **Work in Community**
Most exercises are designed for group work. The Flotilla (your 2-4 person study group) provides:

- **Reality testing**: Others can spot patterns you miss
- **Safety**: Prevents isolation and paranoia
- **Accountability**: Keeps you engaged with the practices
- **Perspective**: Different viewpoints enrich understanding

### **Start Small, Build Gradually**

- Begin with **B.1** (Flotilla Formation) - this is your foundation
- Complete **B.2** (Three Spheres Audit) to understand your starting point
- Practice awareness exercises (**B.3** and **B.4**) for several weeks
- Only attempt **B.5** (30-Day Protocol) after mastering the basics

### **Document Your Experience**
Keep a simple log of:

- What you notice during exercises
- Resistance or challenges that arise
- Insights or "aha" moments
- Changes in your daily experience

### **Adapt to Your Context**
These exercises are frameworks, not rigid prescriptions. Modify them to fit:

- Your schedule and lifestyle
- Your cultural context
- Your personal learning style
- Your group's needs and dynamics

---

## Safety and Support

### **When to Pause**
Stop any exercise if you experience:

- Overwhelming anxiety or panic
- Paranoid thinking or conspiracy obsession
- Social isolation or withdrawal from normal activities
- Inability to function in daily life

### **Getting Support**

- **First**: Discuss with your Flotilla
- **Second**: Seek professional counseling if needed
- **Third**: Take a break from the material and return when ready

### **Remember the Goal**
The purpose is **liberation, not destabilization**. These practices should increase your:

- Clarity and discernment
- Emotional regulation
- Authentic relationships
- Practical effectiveness
- Joy and playfulness

If an exercise is decreasing these qualities, modify your approach or seek support.
