# Chapter 35: The Litmus Tests: Laughter, Children, Crisis, Exit

Cold Open — After the Storm
“Who called you?” I asked.
“Nobody,” she said, wringing rain from her sleeves. “We have a list.” A neighbor passed a thermos and a towel down the line.

Artifact: Exit Ritual (scriptlet)

- “Thank you for your season here. What do you want blessed as you go?”
- “What handover do you want to leave?”
- “What thread do you want to keep?”


How we’ll know it’s working:

- The Laughter Test: joy and humor are normal; play resurfaces
- The Children Test: fertility Desire/Reality Gap narrows by choice
- The Crisis Test: members run toward the community in hardship
- The Exit Test: easy entry, graceful exit without ostracism

## How to Measure (Lightweight)

- Quarterly pulse survey with four 1–5 sliders and a free‑text anecdote box
- Track deltas, not absolutes; compare within each Hub over time
- Share a one‑page summary at the Annual Festival

## Using the Results

- If laughter and belonging stall: add ritual play blocks to gatherings
- If crisis responses falter: run a mutual aid drill with debrief
- If exits are messy: host an “exit rehearsal” ritual; publish a template

These tests keep the Ark human, not merely functional.
