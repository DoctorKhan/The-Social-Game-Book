# Chapter 75: The Incentive System: Reputation → Badges → Influence

Cold Open — Badge Night
“Tell us what you saw,” Tino says. “Not numbers. A moment.”
A hand lifts. “Maria stayed late three Tuesdays, sanding splinters out of the benches. No one asked her to. The kids stopped getting cut.” We clap.

Artifact: Attestation Block (example)

- Contributor: Maria
- Work: Sanded seating benches (3 nights)
- Outcome: safer seating; kids used the space
- Vouchers: Tino (steward), Noor (parent), Eli (mentor)

Design goal: align status and meaning with generative contribution. Channel status-seeking into pro-social work.

## Tier 1: Contribution (Reputation)

- Peer‑vouched proof‑of‑work
- Specific attestations tied to real outcomes

## Tier 2: Recognition (Badges)

- Non‑fungible competence markers
- Unlock access and opportunity; celebrate in ritual

## Tier 3: Influence (Weighted Stewardship)

- Voting weight and stewardship roles earned via long‑term service and mentoring

### Guardrails

- Reputation decay and re‑verification
- Novice voice protection (equal votes on core rights)
- Qualitative primacy over metrics (wisdom councils interpret)
- Forgiveness protocol for repair after failure


## Reputation Sources and Attestations

- Artifact links (docs, PRs, photos) + one‑line outcome
- Service attestations (hours, beneficiaries) by 2+ peers
- Mentorship attestations (who, what skill, duration)
- Stewardship attestations (role, term, handover doc)

## Badges Taxonomy (initial)

- Skill Badges (craft/competence)
- Stewardship Badges (roles held well)
- Integrity Badges (conflict repair, truth‑telling under pressure)
- Culture Badges (rituals, festivals, story stewardship)

## Influence Mechanics

- Scope‑limited influence: weight applies to domains tied to your badges
- Term‑bound: influence decays unless renewed via service/mentorship
- Diversity floor: decisions require mixed badges (skill + integrity, etc.) present

## Anti‑Gaming & Safety

- Vouch diversity: at least 3 unrelated peers (no reciprocal loop) for major badges
- Random audits: small, friendly reviews of 5% of attestations per quarter
- Decay by default: unattended reputation halves after 12 months
- Appeal path: restorative review with a mixed council; emphasis on repair

## Ritualization (Make It Human)

- Quarterly “Badge Night” where stories of contribution are told before badges are issued
- “Passing the Lantern”: outgoing stewards bless incoming ones with a short speech and a handover doc

## Failure Modes and Recovery

- Collusion rings: break via vouch diversity + audits; freeze badges pending review
- Popularity capture: prioritize integrity badges in tie‑breaks; rotate facilitators
- Over‑quantification: pair every metric view with a story circle before decisions
