# Chapter 65: Mini Case: A Small-Scale Win

A micro‑pattern that consistently helps new hubs.

## Problem
Onboarding stalled. Newcomers attended once, then vanished.

## Intervention (90 days)

- Three‑person Welcome Wagon
- Warm handoff to one Flotilla lead after the first visit
- 48‑hour follow‑up message with next steps and one small ask to contribute

## Result

- Onboarding time cut roughly in half
- 30‑day return visits increased from ~25% to ~60%
- Early belonging self‑report rose by ~0.8 on 1–5 scale

## Why It Works

- Lowers activation energy; creates a named social bridge; signals that contribution is expected and welcomed

Replicate freely; tune to context.
