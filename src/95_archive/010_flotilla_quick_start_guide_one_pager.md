# Chapter 5: Flotilla Quick‑Start Guide (One‑Pager)

Your first step: form a 3–5 person Flotilla and commit to the Five Protocols.

1) Commit Together

- Read the charter aloud; agree to: Lab not church; stories not advice; mirror not sword; confidentiality; the work is the goal

2) First Meeting (90 minutes)

- Check‑in: what brought you here?
- Charter reading + verbal agreement
- Short shared reading
- Guided discussion (round‑robin)
- Logistics: schedule next meeting
- Closing word

3) Your 30‑Day Startup

- Weekly meeting cadence
- One small mutual aid action
- One shared mini‑project plan
- Practice one conflict repair technique

4) Protocols (Always On)

- Proof‑of‑Work: show up and contribute tangibly
- Reputation: vouch for specific contributions
- Mentorship: teach what you know
