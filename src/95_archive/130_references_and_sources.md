# Chapter 62: References and Sources

This appendix consolidates sources cited or implied throughout The Social Game. It favors meta‑reviews and high‑signal studies over exhaustive listings.

- Social architecture and urban design (walkability, third places, Filled Middle)
- Education research (attention fragmentation, mixed‑age learning, movement and learning)
- Play science (rough‑and‑tumble play, self‑regulation, creativity)
- Public health and ecology (regenerative agriculture, biodiversity, human health outcomes)
- Gender and development (statistical patterns, classroom outcomes, labor market dynamics)

Chapters use bracketed callouts instead of inline citations: [see: References and Sources].
