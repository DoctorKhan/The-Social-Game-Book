## Chapter 5: The Game That Never Ends

Normally, when a game becomes this unbalanced and ceases to be fun, you reset it. You flip the board, shuffle the cards, and start over again. But what happens when you believe that leaving the game means death? You can’t reset a game you don't know you're playing.

Because we have mistaken our game for survival itself, the idea of a reset has become unthinkable. To question the rules is to question reality. And so we keep playing, circling the board, paying rent, even as the game becomes more pointless and punishing. It is the game that never ends, precisely because we have forgotten it is a game at all.

We have forgotten our nature as players. And this profound act of forgetting has turned our playground into a prison, where the bars are not made of iron, but of rules we no longer realize we invented.

### Why We Don’t Reset

- Loss of shared reality: resets require collective agreement, but the board is fragmented by information silos and engineered outrage.
- Learned helplessness: when every move feels like it only enriches the owners, apathy masquerades as wisdom.
- Survival theater: institutions perform protection; we perform compliance. Both sides are too invested in the script to call cut.

### The Way Out (Foreshadow)

We don’t win by flipping the board; we win by building another table—one that remembers we are players first. In Part II, we’ll gather evidence of how the current game captures play. In Part III, we’ll study the engine beneath the game. Then we’ll practice the moves that return sovereignty to the player.

Next: Part II — The Investigation.
