# Chapter 2: Your First Mission: Assemble Your Flotilla

The systems we are about to investigate are designed to isolate, confuse, and overwhelm the individual mind. To proceed safely, you must not proceed alone.

This is your first and most critical assignment.

## The Flotilla Principle

In treacherous seas, sailors lash their boats together. A single vessel can be swamped by a storm, but a flotilla creates a stable, resilient platform.

This investigation is that storm. The psychological and social patterns we will uncover are powerful. A small, trusted group provides the necessary stability to navigate them. When you investigate together, you become immune to the very manipulation techniques you are studying.

## Your Assignment:

**Before proceeding, you must form your Flotilla.**

The complete protocol for this is **Exercise B.1 in Appendix B**. It is a simple process for finding 2-4 trusted peers to explore this material with you.

Do not skip this step. Your Flotilla is your laboratory and your shield.

The resistance begins with connection.
