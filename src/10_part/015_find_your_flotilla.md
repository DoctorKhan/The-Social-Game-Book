# Chapter 2: Find Your Flotilla

The grackles showed me what we'd lostâ€”but they also revealed what was still possible. If we're going to investigate how human social intelligence has been systematically disrupted, we need to start rebuilding it.

**This investigation is too dangerous to undertake alone.**

## The Flotilla Principle

Imagine sailors navigating treacherous waters. Instead of sailing alone, they lash their boats together, creating a stable platform that can weather storms no individual vessel could survive.

## Your Assignment

**Why this matters**: By consciously creating small, trusted communities based on mutual support and shared inquiry, you're already building the alternative to isolation-based control systems.

**The resistance begins with connection.**
