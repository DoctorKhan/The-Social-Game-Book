## Chapter 1: Let's Pretend

Something happened around 70,000 years ago. After hundreds of thousands of years of making the same stone tools, the lights suddenly switched on. A creative explosion of art, sophisticated tools, and complex culture bloomed across the globe. Geneticists like David Reich suggest this might have been a “founder event.” Among the many small, isolated groups of early humans, one group innovated a new way of thinking, a mutation not just in their genes—like the FOXP2 gene linked to language—but in their culture. This group and its descendants thrived and spread, absorbing or replacing all others.

What was this world-altering innovation? It was the ability to believe in something that isn’t literal and still act as if it were true. It was the birth of “let’s pretend.”

This cognitive leap allowed us to invent and share fictions. With the simple phrase “what if?” we could detach from the immediate present. The stunning cave paintings of Lascaux were not just decorations; they were virtual reality simulators, coaching manuals for the hunt. A coach uses a whiteboard to diagram a football play; our ancestors used a cave wall to diagram a bison hunt, teaching strategy and teamwork through representation.

Stories became tools for survival. A narrative about a hero who eats the red berries and dies is a far more effective and memorable lesson than a simple command. The story doesn't have to be literally true to teach a deeper truth. Through shared fictions—myths, laws, gods, and nations—we learned to cooperate in massive numbers. We learned to play.

### The Technology of Make‑Believe

Money is a story printed on paper (or encoded in a database). Passports, borders, corporations, calendars—these are all shared agreements. They work because enough of us agree to play by the same rules at the same time. Within this mythology, rules are not mere constraints; they are creative instruments. By coordinating attention and behavior, rules let us build things that no individual could build alone.

Play is the first protocol of human intelligence. In play, we suspend the immediate demands of the moment and enter a safe container where we can model possibilities, try roles, fail without catastrophe, and learn at extraordinary speed. Our ancestors played at the hunt before the hunt; we play at the future before it arrives.

When play becomes shared fiction at scale, civilization emerges. We choreograph cooperation with symbols and stories—first around the fire, then on clay tablets and law codes, and now on screens. The power has always been the same: people, synchronized by imagination.

### Why This Matters Now

If the core of our species-technology is “let’s pretend,” then whoever writes the rules of pretending writes the shape of our lives. A culture’s myths, metrics, and interfaces are not neutral; they channel attention, emotion, and energy. When the rules are humane, play lifts us. When the rules are extractive, play is captured and turned against us.

Part I is the memory of what we are. Part II will follow the clues of how that memory was obscured. But first, we ground the biology that makes this possible.
