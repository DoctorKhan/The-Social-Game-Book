## Part 1: The Lost Art of Community
## Clues from Thriving Communities

*"Before we can solve the crisis, we must understand what was stolen. What does authentic community actually look like?"*

Our investigation begins not with the crime scene, but with looking for clues about what healthy human community actually is. If modern communities are failing, where can we find examples of thriving? Are there anomalies—exceptions—that hint at the underlying principles we've lost?

Our investigators, working independently, each stumbled upon pieces of this puzzle in unexpected places.
