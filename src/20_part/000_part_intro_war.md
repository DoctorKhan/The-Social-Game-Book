# Part II Cold Open — Sirens

The bombs dropped all around us.

My parents lost friends—some to the chaos, some to the violence. My mother was shot in the leg, a wound that would never fully heal. They were lucky, if luck means simply making it through alive. I grew up with the sound of sirens braided into the sound of rain.

I tell you this not to provoke fear, but to name the mechanism: war is what happens when a civilization’s uncontained stresses find the only release valve the system still permits. When the Hollow Middle has been removed, when kinship buffers and alliance federations are gone, pressure has nowhere to go but outward.

Part II is the autopsy. If Part I was the discovery that the problem isn’t the people but the operating system, then this is where we map the brittle architecture that turns unresolved charge into violence. We are not a broken people. We are a healthy people living in a broken system—and a broken system defaults to war.

The rules of the game begin here.
