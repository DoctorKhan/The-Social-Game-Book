# The Ancient Control System: How They Perfected the Art of Division

My discoveries in Bali, Hawaii, and the desert had shown me that natural human coordination was possible. But I needed to understand what was systematically preventing it. The answer came when I witnessed something that changed everything.

I was sitting in a coffee shop in Austin, watching two friends—Mike and Sarah—destroy their relationship in real-time. Mike, a white construction worker, was explaining how he couldn't get promoted because of diversity hiring. Sarah, a Black teacher, was explaining how the school system was systematically underfunding her predominantly minority students.

"You don't understand what it's like to compete against quotas," Mike said, his voice rising.

"And you don't understand what it's like to be a person of color in this country," Sarah shot back.

I watched these two people—who should have been natural allies against the economic systems that were squeezing them both—tear their friendship apart over the 20% where they disagreed. And suddenly, I understood something that had been haunting me since my discoveries in Bali, Hawaii, and the desert.

Natural human coordination was possible. I had seen it work beautifully. But something was systematically preventing it. And sitting in that coffee shop, watching two good people destroy their relationship, I realized I was witnessing a technology of control so ancient and so effective that it had been running for over 2,000 years.

What I found when I started researching was chilling: **the same playbook has been used across all of human history.**

## The Universal Vulnerability

**The observation that haunted me:** Across all cultures and time periods, humans fall for the same manipulation techniques with stunning consistency. The specific content changes—race, religion, politics, generation—but the underlying pattern remains identical. Why are we so universally programmable?

I thought about Sarah and Mike, about how easily their genuine friendship had been weaponized against itself. This wasn't just about modern politics or social media algorithms. This was about something fundamental in human psychology—something so universal that it suggested these vulnerabilities might be built into the very architecture of human consciousness.

**The anomaly:** People who agreed on 80% of issues fought viciously over the remaining 20%. Neighbors who shared the same economic struggles blamed each other instead of the systems creating those struggles. Communities that should naturally ally against common threats fragmented into hostile tribes.

**The great question:** Why do these same patterns work across all cultures, all time periods, all levels of education and intelligence?

**My hypothesis:** The manipulation techniques work because they exploit something universal in human psychology—something so fundamental that it suggests these vulnerabilities might be built into the very architecture of human consciousness.

## The Pattern Across History

It starts with the Romans. They called it *Divide et Impera*—divide and conquer. But I found the same strategy used throughout history, and it's still running today.

**146 BCE—Rome conquers Greece:** Not through superior military force alone, but by turning the Greek city-states against each other. They promised Athens advantages over Sparta, Sparta advantages over Thebes. By the time the Greeks realized what was happening, they were too busy fighting each other to resist Rome.

**1757-1947—British control of India:** The British had 300,000 troops trying to control 300 million Indians. Impossible odds. So they elevated the Sikhs to police the Hindus, the Hindus to police the Muslims, the Muslims to police the Sikhs. They weaponized existing divisions and created new ones. The Indians spent more energy fighting each other than fighting the British.

**Industrial Revolution—Gender as Weapon:** Factory owners discovered they could break male-dominated unions by hiring women at lower wages, turning gender into a weapon against worker solidarity.

**Soviet Revolution—Class Warfare:** The Bolsheviks allied with poor peasants against the middle class to eliminate potential resistance, then turned on their peasant allies once power was consolidated.

**2004-Present—Social Media "Engagement":** The algorithms don't create division—they amplify existing divisions because division drives engagement. People spend more time arguing than agreeing. More time angry than content. The platforms profit from the conflict.

## The Core Mechanism

My research revealed the core mechanism behind divide and conquer: **Allying with a weaker group to turn them against a stronger group, thereby preventing the stronger group from challenging power.**

I traced this pattern across history and realized I was looking at the continuous refinement of a single, devastating technology of power that exploited something fundamental about human tribal psychology.

**The Universal Pattern:**

Through my research into political strategy, I discovered how the industry used "micro-targeting" and "wedge issues." The goal was to find the 20% of issues where people disagreed and amplify those disagreements until they overshadowed the 80% where people agreed.

**The revelation that stopped me cold:** I found the same playbook being used by opposing sides. Progressive groups wanted to make rural voters look like ignorant bigots. Conservative groups wanted to make urban voters look like elitist snobs. But both strategies were designed to prevent these groups from talking to each other about the economic policies that were affecting them both.

Reading Machiavelli's "The Prince," one passage crystallized everything: *"The best way to keep your subjects obedient is to keep them divided against each other. United people can overthrow any ruler, but divided people will fight each other instead of fighting you."*

But even Machiavelli felt like a recent student of a much older school. This strategy wasn't just a political trick; it felt like a fundamental law of power, a kind of social physics that had been engineered into human civilization from its very foundation.

## The Elite Calculation

What I came to call the 'Elite Calculation' isn't a conspiracy—it's a strategic principle that gets rediscovered by every power structure because it works so well.

**The Elite Calculation:**

1. **Identify existing divisions** in the population (race, class, gender, religion, region)
2. **Amplify those divisions** through media, policy, and resource allocation
3. **Channel grievances horizontally** (group vs. group) rather than vertically (people vs. power)
4. **Maintain power** while the population fights itself

**The key insight:** When people are fighting each other, they're not questioning the system that creates the conditions they're fighting about.

## The Modern Application

I started seeing this pattern everywhere in contemporary life:

**Horizontal Conflict:** People fighting with their spouses about money instead of questioning why wages haven't kept up with productivity. Fighting with neighbors about property values instead of questioning why housing has become unaffordable. Fighting with other parents about school policies instead of questioning why education funding keeps getting cut.

What I came to call the 'Elite Calculation' isn't a conspiracy—it's a strategic principle that gets rediscovered by every power structure because it works so well.

**The Elite Calculation:**

1. **Identify existing divisions** in the population (race, class, gender, religion, region)
2. **Amplify those divisions** through media, policy, and resource allocation
3. **Channel grievances horizontally** (group vs. group) rather than vertically (people vs. power)
4. **Maintain power** while the population fights itself

**The Sincere Believer Trap:** Elites didn't need to share the weaker group's ideology; they only needed to support their cause *just enough* to trigger a reaction from the stronger group. Both sides would then focus on fighting each other, exhausting their energy and preventing the formation of a unified opposition that could challenge the elite.

## The Funding Trail

My research into online 'activist' groups revealed a disturbing pattern. These groups that amplify racial conflict, generational conflict, gender conflict—when you trace the funding, it leads back to corporate foundations and think tanks that also lobby for deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and policies that hurt all working-class people regardless of race or gender.

**The pattern:** They fund the fight to distract from the theft.

But I realized it's not always that conscious. My data showed that platforms amplify division because it's profitable—it drives engagement. It's an emergent property of the system, not necessarily a smoky back room conspiracy.

However, the strategy is absolutely conscious for political operatives. It's a feedback loop: political strategists create divisive content, and algorithms amplify it automatically. The system has learned to automate the playbook.

## The Modern Innovation: Beyond Machiavelli

But here's what puzzled me: Machiavelli was writing about city-states where people still lived in extended families, guilds, and tight-knit communities. These natural bonds provided alternative sources of identity, mutual aid, and collective action that limited elite control.

Modern systems had evolved beyond what Machiavelli could have imagined. Rather than working around existing community bonds, modern political and technological systems had created incentives that systematically weakened traditional social structures while amplifying tribal divisions.

**The breakthrough insight:** Machiavelli's prince had to work around existing communities. But modern systems had figured out how to destroy the communities first, then create artificial tribes that served elite interests.

I realized I was witnessing the unconscious implementation of what Machiavelli called **Law 7: "Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit."** The real power holders weren't taking sides in the culture wars—they were getting ordinary people to fight each other while the elites maintained control.

## The Machiavellian Principles in Action

I began cataloging other Machiavellian principles being used:

**Law 3: "Conceal your intentions"** - Political movements that claim to serve the people while actually serving corporate interests.

**Law 6: "Court attention at all costs"** - Creating spectacles and controversies that distract from substantive policy changes.

**Law 17: "Keep others in suspended terror"** - Constant messaging about threats from the opposing political tribe.

**Law 27: "Play on people's need to believe"** - Crafting narratives that made people feel like righteous warriors for justice.

**Law 33: "Discover each man's thumbscrew"** - Micro-targeting based on psychological profiles to find each voter's emotional triggers.

## The Civil Rights Scapegoating Matrix

My investigation revealed how legitimate civil rights movements had been systematically co-opted to serve divide-and-conquer strategies. The pattern was always the same: take real grievances from marginalized groups and channel them horizontally against other struggling groups rather than vertically against the systems creating the oppression.

### Racial Scapegoating: The Classic Model

**The Setup**: Economic policies concentrate wealth upward, leaving working-class communities of all races competing for shrinking resources.

**The Scapegoating**:

- **Working-class whites** are taught that **minorities** are taking "their" jobs through affirmative action and immigration
- **Minority communities** are encouraged to see **working-class whites** as the primary source of racism, rather than systemic economic policies
- **Both groups** fight over access to declining opportunities while wealth extraction accelerates

**The Distraction**: While communities argue about racial preferences in hiring, the same corporations move jobs overseas, automate positions, and lobby for policies that hurt all workers regardless of race.

**The Result**: Two groups with shared economic interests exhaust their energy fighting each other instead of organizing against the systems impoverishing them both.

### Gender Scapegoating: The Wage Competition Trap

**The Setup**: Economic policies make single-income households impossible for most families, forcing both parents into the workforce.

**The Scapegoating**:

- **Men** are taught that **feminism** destroyed their role as providers and made them expendable
- **Women** are taught that **male privilege** is the primary obstacle to their advancement
- **Both groups** compete for jobs in an economy designed to suppress wages for everyone

**The Distraction**: While men and women fight about workplace equality, the same economic policies suppress wages, eliminate benefits, and make family formation economically impossible for both sexes.

**The Result**: The two groups that need to cooperate most to create stable families and communities are turned against each other.

#### **The Automated Gender War**

This dynamic of channeling grievances horizontally is now so pervasive that it has become the primary lens through which young people interpret their economic and social struggles. Richard Reeves observes that an immense amount of "political energy young men and young women are spending on blaming each other for their challenges, rather than being shoulder-to-shoulder and fighting for more a fairer economy." [Source: Galloway, Haidt, & Reeves Video Transcript]

This is the Elite Calculation in its most elegant and devastating modern form. The System does not even need to invent the division; it merely needs to amplify it. As Reeves notes, it's "almost like a conspiracy between the progressive left and the reactionary right to get young men and young women to blame each other for their problems rather than the economy, rather than the institutions that are failing both of them." [Source: Galloway, Haidt, & Reeves Video Transcript]

The progressive narrative can frame female struggle as a direct result of patriarchy and toxic masculinity. The reactionary narrative can frame male struggle as a direct result of feminism and female empowerment. Both narratives achieve the same strategic goal: they point the finger horizontally, ensuring that the two groups with the most to gain from cooperating against a failing economic system exhaust their energy fighting each other. The result is a perfectly balanced, self-perpetuating conflict that prevents any serious vertical challenge to the System itself.


## The Automated Divide and Conquer Engine

**The great realization:** This is a marriage of ancient strategy and modern technology. The 'what' is two thousand years old. The 'how' is brand new. The result is a perfectly automated engine of division that channels legitimate grievances into conflicts that don't threaten the power structure.

The system has become so sophisticated that it can:

- **Identify natural human divisions** through data analysis
- **Amplify those divisions** through algorithmic content curation
- **Channel energy horizontally** through engagement optimization
- **Maintain elite power** while people exhaust themselves fighting each other

**The human cost**: People become so exhausted from fighting horizontal battles that they have no energy left to question the vertical power structures that are actually controlling their lives.

## The Realization

We're not looking at separate historical incidents. We're looking at the same strategy being deployed repeatedly because it works. And it's not just historical—it's happening right now, in real-time, through the systems we've built.

**The great question**: How do you fight a strategy that's been perfected over millennia?

**The answer**: First, we have to help people see it. Most people don't realize they're fighting horizontal battles. They think their marriage problems are about their spouse, not about economic stress. They think their neighborhood conflicts are about property values, not about housing policy.

**The investigation needed**: We need to map the current deployment of this strategy—trace the algorithmic amplification, analyze the institutional structures that benefit from fragmentation, and document the psychological impact on individual mental health and community resilience.

## The Great Mystery Deepens

What had started as observations about modern social problems had revealed itself as part of a much larger historical pattern. I wasn't just investigating a contemporary crisis—I was investigating a strategy that's been used to control populations for over two thousand years.

**The sophistication**: It's more sophisticated now than it's ever been. Digital technology allows real-time manipulation of social behavior at unprecedented scale.

**The power of recognition**: Understanding the pattern gives us power. You can't be manipulated by a strategy you can see clearly.

**The ultimate question**: Can we help others see it too? Can we build immunity to this kind of manipulation?

## Key Discoveries

As I concluded this phase of my research, I had identified several crucial insights:

1. **The Divide and Conquer strategy is not new**—it's been used successfully by power structures for over 2,000 years
2. **The strategy is not necessarily conspiratorial**—it's a principle that gets rediscovered because it works
3. **Modern technology amplifies the strategy**—digital systems can manipulate social behavior at unprecedented scale
4. **The strategy channels legitimate grievances horizontally**—group vs. group rather than people vs. power
5. **Recognition of the pattern is the first step toward immunity**—you can't be manipulated by what you can see clearly

*As I concluded this research, I realized I had crossed a threshold. I was no longer just observing the fragmentation of human community—I was actively working to heal it. My investigation had become a form of resistance.*

*The ancient playbook was powerful, but it had a weakness: it only worked when people couldn't see it clearly. The next task was to map out exactly how this playbook was being deployed in the modern world to dismantle the very pillars of community I had uncovered.*
