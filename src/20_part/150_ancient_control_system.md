Mike, a software engineer, complained that H1B visas were flooding the job market and making it harder for him to get ahead. Sarah, a teacher, described how budget cuts were making her work nearly impossible. Both were squeezed by the same economy, but instead of seeing their shared struggle, they turned against each other over the 20% where they disagreed.

If we can find a scapegoat—even when there is a legitimate complaint—it distracts us from the true source of the problem. The energy that could be used to address systemic issues gets redirected into blaming each other, leaving the underlying forces untouched.
# The Scapegoating Machine


The clues proved it: natural human coordination is possible. So what keeps breaking it? I found my answer in a coffee shop, watching two friends—Mike and Sarah—destroy their relationship in real time.

Mike, a software engineer, complained that H1B visas were flooding the job market and making it harder for him to get ahead. Sarah, a teacher, described how budget cuts were making her work nearly impossible. Both were squeezed by the same economy, but instead of seeing their shared struggle, they turned against each other over the 20% where they disagreed.

That day I realized I wasn’t watching a debate. I was watching a technology. Ancient. Effective. Still running.

## The Universal Vulnerability

Across time and culture, humans fall for the same manipulation. The content changes—race, religion, generation—but the pattern is identical. Why are we so programmable?

The anomaly: people who agree on 80% fight over the rest. Neighbors with shared struggles blame each other instead of the systems creating those struggles. Natural allies fragment into hostile tribes.

The hypothesis: these techniques exploit something universal in human psychology—vulnerabilities built into our social architecture.

## The Pattern Across History

Rome named it: Divide et Impera. Everyone else just kept using it.

- 146 BCE — Rome vs. Greece: Flip city‑states against each other with promises and favors. By the time they looked up, Rome was inside the gates.
- 1757–1947 — British Raj: 300k troops, 300M Indians. Elevate Sikhs over Hindus, Hindus over Muslims, then rotate. Weaponize fault lines.
- Industrial Revolution — Gender as Wedge: Break unions by hiring women at lower wages; turn wage pressure into gender war.
- Soviet Revolution — Class as Blade: Ally with peasants to break the middle; then cut the peasants when power consolidates.
- 2004–present — Algorithmic Engagement: Division drives clicks. Platforms amplify what fragments us because rage retains attention.

## The Core Mechanism

Ally a weaker group against a stronger group so the strong never organize vertically. Rinse and repeat.

Political strategy operationalizes this with micro‑targeting and wedge issues: maximize the 20% of disagreement until it eclipses the 80% of common ground.

The unnerving part: both sides run the same playbook. Each caricatures the other to prevent contact at the level where real interests align.

Machiavelli wrote it simply: keep subjects divided and they will police themselves. Modern systems have automated the tactic.

## The Elite Calculation

What I came to call the 'Elite Calculation' isn't a conspiracy—it's a strategic principle that gets rediscovered by every power structure because it works so well.

**The Elite Calculation:**

1. **Identify existing divisions** in the population (race, class, gender, religion, region)
2. **Amplify those divisions** through media, policy, and resource allocation
3. **Channel grievances horizontally** (group vs. group) rather than vertically (people vs. power)
4. **Maintain power** while the population fights itself

**The key insight:** When people are fighting each other, they're not questioning the system that creates the conditions they're fighting about.

## The Modern Application

I started seeing this pattern everywhere in contemporary life:

**Horizontal Conflict:** People fighting with their spouses about money instead of questioning why wages haven't kept up with productivity. Fighting with neighbors about property values instead of questioning why housing has become unaffordable. Fighting with other parents about school policies instead of questioning why education funding keeps getting cut.

What I came to call the 'Elite Calculation' isn't a conspiracy—it's a strategic principle that gets rediscovered by every power structure because it works so well.

**The Elite Calculation:**

1. **Identify existing divisions** in the population (race, class, gender, religion, region)
2. **Amplify those divisions** through media, policy, and resource allocation
3. **Channel grievances horizontally** (group vs. group) rather than vertically (people vs. power)
4. **Maintain power** while the population fights itself

**The Sincere Believer Trap:** Elites didn't need to share the weaker group's ideology; they only needed to support their cause *just enough* to trigger a reaction from the stronger group. Both sides would then focus on fighting each other, exhausting their energy and preventing the formation of a unified opposition that could challenge the elite.

## The Funding Trail

My research into online 'activist' groups revealed a disturbing pattern. These groups that amplify racial conflict, generational conflict, gender conflict—when you trace the funding, it leads back to corporate foundations and think tanks that also lobby for deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and policies that hurt all working-class people regardless of race or gender.

**The pattern:** They fund the fight to distract from the theft.

But I realized it's not always that conscious. My data showed that platforms amplify division because it's profitable—it drives engagement. It's an emergent property of the system, not necessarily a smoky back room conspiracy.

However, the strategy is absolutely conscious for political operatives. It's a feedback loop: political strategists create divisive content, and algorithms amplify it automatically. The system has learned to automate the playbook.

## The Modern Innovation: Beyond Machiavelli

But here's what puzzled me: Machiavelli was writing about city-states where people still lived in extended families, guilds, and tight-knit communities. These natural bonds provided alternative sources of identity, mutual aid, and collective action that limited elite control.

Modern systems had evolved beyond what Machiavelli could have imagined. Rather than working around existing community bonds, modern political and technological systems had created incentives that systematically weakened traditional social structures while amplifying tribal divisions.

**The breakthrough insight:** Machiavelli's prince had to work around existing communities. But modern systems had figured out how to destroy the communities first, then create artificial tribes that served elite interests.

I realized I was witnessing the unconscious implementation of what Machiavelli called **Law 7: "Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit."** The real power holders weren't taking sides in the culture wars—they were getting ordinary people to fight each other while the elites maintained control.

## The Machiavellian Principles in Action

I began cataloging other Machiavellian principles being used:

**Law 3: "Conceal your intentions"** - Political movements that claim to serve the people while actually serving corporate interests.

**Law 6: "Court attention at all costs"** - Creating spectacles and controversies that distract from substantive policy changes.

**Law 17: "Keep others in suspended terror"** - Constant messaging about threats from the opposing political tribe.

**Law 27: "Play on people's need to believe"** - Crafting narratives that made people feel like righteous warriors for justice.

**Law 33: "Discover each man's thumbscrew"** - Micro-targeting based on psychological profiles to find each voter's emotional triggers.

## The Civil Rights Scapegoating Matrix

My investigation revealed how legitimate civil rights movements had been systematically co-opted to serve divide-and-conquer strategies. The pattern was always the same: take real grievances from marginalized groups and channel them horizontally against other struggling groups rather than vertically against the systems creating the oppression.

### Racial Scapegoating: The Classic Model

**The Setup**: Economic policies concentrate wealth upward, leaving working-class communities of all races competing for shrinking resources.

**The Scapegoating**:

- **Working-class whites** are taught that **minorities** are taking "their" jobs through affirmative action and immigration
- **Minority communities** are encouraged to see **working-class whites** as the primary source of racism, rather than systemic economic policies
- **Both groups** fight over access to declining opportunities while wealth extraction accelerates

**The Distraction**: While communities argue about racial preferences in hiring, the same corporations move jobs overseas, automate positions, and lobby for policies that hurt all workers regardless of race.

**The Result**: Two groups with shared economic interests exhaust their energy fighting each other instead of organizing against the systems impoverishing them both.

### Gender Scapegoating: The Wage Competition Trap

**The Setup**: Economic policies make single-income households impossible for most families, forcing both parents into the workforce.

**The Scapegoating**:

- **Men** are taught that **feminism** destroyed their role as providers and made them expendable
- **Women** are taught that **male privilege** is the primary obstacle to their advancement
- **Both groups** compete for jobs in an economy designed to suppress wages for everyone

**The Distraction**: While men and women fight about workplace equality, the same economic policies suppress wages, eliminate benefits, and make family formation economically impossible for both sexes.

**The Result**: The two groups that need to cooperate most to create stable families and communities are turned against each other.

#### **The Automated Gender War**

This dynamic of channeling grievances horizontally is now so pervasive that it has become the primary lens through which young people interpret their economic and social struggles. Richard Reeves observes that an immense amount of "political energy young men and young women are spending on blaming each other for their challenges, rather than being shoulder-to-shoulder and fighting for more a fairer economy." [Source: Galloway, Haidt, & Reeves Video Transcript]

This is the Elite Calculation in its most elegant and devastating modern form. The System does not even need to invent the division; it merely needs to amplify it. As Reeves notes, it's "almost like a conspiracy between the progressive left and the reactionary right to get young men and young women to blame each other for their problems rather than the economy, rather than the institutions that are failing both of them." [Source: Galloway, Haidt, & Reeves Video Transcript]

The progressive narrative can frame female struggle as a direct result of patriarchy and toxic masculinity. The reactionary narrative can frame male struggle as a direct result of feminism and female empowerment. Both narratives achieve the same strategic goal: they point the finger horizontally, ensuring that the two groups with the most to gain from cooperating against a failing economic system exhaust their energy fighting each other. The result is a perfectly balanced, self-perpetuating conflict that prevents any serious vertical challenge to the System itself.


## The Automated Divide and Conquer Engine

**The great realization:** This is a marriage of ancient strategy and modern technology. The 'what' is two thousand years old. The 'how' is brand new. The result is a perfectly automated engine of division that channels legitimate grievances into conflicts that don't threaten the power structure.

The system has become so sophisticated that it can:

- **Identify natural human divisions** through data analysis
- **Amplify those divisions** through algorithmic content curation
- **Channel energy horizontally** through engagement optimization
- **Maintain elite power** while people exhaust themselves fighting each other

**The human cost**: People become so exhausted from fighting horizontal battles that they have no energy left to question the vertical power structures that are actually controlling their lives.

## The Realization

We're not looking at separate historical incidents. We're looking at the same strategy being deployed repeatedly because it works. And it's not just historical—it's happening right now, in real-time, through the systems we've built.

**The great question**: How do you fight a strategy that's been perfected over millennia?

**The answer**: First, we have to help people see it. Most people don't realize they're fighting horizontal battles. They think their marriage problems are about their spouse, not about economic stress. They think their neighborhood conflicts are about property values, not about housing policy.

**The investigation needed**: We need to map the current deployment of this strategy—trace the algorithmic amplification, analyze the institutional structures that benefit from fragmentation, and document the psychological impact on individual mental health and community resilience.

## The Great Mystery Deepens

What had started as observations about modern social problems had revealed itself as part of a much larger historical pattern. I wasn't just investigating a contemporary crisis—I was investigating a strategy that's been used to control populations for over two thousand years.

**The sophistication**: It's more sophisticated now than it's ever been. Digital technology allows real-time manipulation of social behavior at unprecedented scale.

**The power of recognition**: Understanding the pattern gives us power. You can't be manipulated by a strategy you can see clearly.

**The ultimate question**: Can we help others see it too? Can we build immunity to this kind of manipulation?

## Key Discoveries

As I concluded this phase of my research, I had identified several crucial insights:

1. **The Divide and Conquer strategy is not new**—it's been used successfully by power structures for over 2,000 years
2. **The strategy is not necessarily conspiratorial**—it's a principle that gets rediscovered because it works
3. **Modern technology amplifies the strategy**—digital systems can manipulate social behavior at unprecedented scale
4. **The strategy channels legitimate grievances horizontally**—group vs. group rather than people vs. power
5. **Recognition of the pattern is the first step toward immunity**—you can't be manipulated by what you can see clearly

*As I concluded this research, I realized I had crossed a threshold. I was no longer just observing the fragmentation of human community—I was actively working to heal it. My investigation had become a form of resistance.*

*The ancient playbook was powerful, but it had a weakness: it only worked when people couldn't see it clearly. The next task was to map out exactly how this playbook was being deployed in the modern world to dismantle the very pillars of community I had uncovered.*
