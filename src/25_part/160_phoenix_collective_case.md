# Case Study: The Phoenix Collective

A small group built a functional “Family‑default” hub inside an Engine world. This is not a fantasy; it already works. The question is scale.

## Context

- 18 core members, mixed ages; 3 Flotillas; urban setting
- Shared studio space; monthly Festival night; rotating stewardship roles
- Newcomer on‑ramp: attend 2 open nights → join a Flotilla shadow for 30 days → apply for Phase 0

## Practices that Mattered

- Embodied proof‑of‑work: contribution walls (photos, artifacts, brief stories)
- Vouching circles: quarterly, each member names 1–2 specific contributions by others
- Conflict repair: 3‑step ritual (name, impact, repair offer) practiced monthly
- Mentorship pledge: every steward mentors one newer member

## Outcomes (informal, early)

- Belonging +1.2 (1–5 scale) over 90 days for new members
- Attendance stability at 85%+ for core events
- Two Flotillas completed Phase 0 with full vouching

## Transferable Pattern

- Make contribution visible → make vouching normal → default to repair over ejection

## Where It Broke

- Steward burnout: too few people held too many roles → mitigated with 3‑month caps
- Onboarding bottleneck: added a “Welcome Wagon” crew to greet and follow‑up

## What to Watch Next

- Can the Festival night be cloned across hubs without losing spirit?
- Does the mentorship pledge improve retention at 6 months?

Note: Replace placeholders with concrete anecdotes and anonymized metrics when ready.
