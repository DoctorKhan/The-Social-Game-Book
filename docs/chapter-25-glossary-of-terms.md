# Glossary of Terms

**Charge / Energetic Charge:** A term used to describe the felt, embodied emotional and psychological energy within a person. A "stable charge" refers to a state of emotional and psychological equilibrium and resilience.

**Charge Pollution:** The degradation of the collective social and informational environment with low-quality, emotionally manipulative, or divisive content, similar to how industrial waste pollutes the physical environment.

**Competency Pattern:** A demonstrable set of skills, behaviors, and levels of understanding that indicate a person's capacity to handle certain levels of responsibility or knowledge. This stands in contrast to authority based merely on credentials or position.

**Multi-Perspective Response:** An approach to understanding events or conflicts by simultaneously considering multiple perspectives or "coordinate systems" (e.g., individual psychology, family systems, social dynamics, spiritual development) rather than relying on a single, simplistic judgment of right or wrong.

**False Hierarchy:** A power structure based on artificial authority, such as social status, credentials without competence, or technological amplification. It is primarily used for control and exploitation rather than genuine guidance and development.

**Social Programming:** The systematic process by which collective systems (media, culture, economic structures, technology) shape individual consciousness, behavior, and relationships to serve institutional interests.

**True Hierarchy:** A structure of authority based on genuine, demonstrable competence, wisdom, and the ability to guide others' development (see *Competency Pattern*). It is oriented toward service and the transmission of knowledge.
